1. Introduction

A description of the problem and a discussion of the background

The Internet revolution brought more than social medias and faster information exchanges. It brought also a generation of people who studies through the digital environments. Under this context, the online education evolved quickly and the transformation of the societies really started. Nowadays, people in distant places, poor countries can benefit from technology to achieve information and in this case, the Massive Open Online Courses, MOOCs had a major role. MOOCs can join people all around the world to achieve understand in a wide range of areas, delivering science and culture.

It is known, also, that online learning suffers massive unenrollment. The logical border and the lack of motivation can make the students leave. Under this context, what are the related features which causes it? How understand the student scenario and predict his churn or low grades? I think that is a relevant point. If MOOCs platforms achieve student understanding and predicting, I think it's possible to menage the student's churn and find a way to give them the needed motivation.

With this set in mind, I started a search for MOOCs generated Students Data to investigate and prepare some conclusions about the theme.
